Soccer Opponent Avoidance - Exhaustive Search versus Dynamic Programming

To run the comparison of an Exhaustive search algorithm versus a Dynamic programming algorithm, type the following command
```
    python3 soccer.py
```
In the output 'Time 1:' represents the exhaustive search algorithm whereas 'Time 2:' represents the dynamic program algorithm, respectively. 


*arr1* through *arr6* numbers can be changed for other results, however it has to be the same 'X' and 'Y' eg `14 x 14`, `20 x 20` etc.
